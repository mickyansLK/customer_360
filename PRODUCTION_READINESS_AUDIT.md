# SCV Project Production Readiness Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The SCV (Single Customer View) project is a dbt-based data pipeline that creates a unified customer view by combining customer data from multiple sources with weather data. While the basic architecture is sound, **the project is NOT production-ready** due to several critical issues that need immediate attention.

**Overall Assessment: 🟡 DEVELOPMENT READY - PRODUCTION NOT READY**

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. 🔴 Data Source Access Issues
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: Weather data source `WEATHER_SOURCE_LLC_FROSTBYTE.ONPOINT_ID."forecast_day"` is not accessible
- **Impact**: Complete pipeline failure - bronze_weather and silver_customer_weather models fail
- **Evidence**: 
  ```
  Object 'WEATHER_SOURCE_LLC_FROSTBYTE.ONPOINT_ID."forecast_day"' does not exist or not authorized.
  ```
- **Action Required**: 
  - Verify Snowflake Marketplace access permissions
  - Set up proper data sharing agreements
  - Implement fallback data sources or mock data for development

### 2. 🔴 Missing Data Quality Tests
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: No data quality tests implemented
- **Impact**: No validation of data integrity, completeness, or accuracy
- **Evidence**: Empty `tests/` directory, no schema tests defined
- **Action Required**:
  - Implement comprehensive testing strategy
  - Add unique, not_null, and relationship tests
  - Create custom business logic tests

### 3. 🔴 Missing Error Handling and Monitoring
**Severity: HIGH**

- **Impact**: Pipeline failures go undetected, no operational visibility
- **Action Required**:
  - Implement proper error handling in models
  - Set up monitoring and alerting
  - Create operational dashboards

## High Priority Issues

           tests:
             - unique
             - not_null
   ```

3. **Add Error Handling**
   ```sql

## Conclusion

The SCV project has a solid foundation with good architecture and clear separation of concerns. However, it requires significant work before it can be considered production-ready. The critical issues around data source access and data quality testing must be resolved immediately.

**Recommended Timeline for Production Readiness: 8-12 weeks**

This timeline assumes dedicated resources and focuses on the critical and high-priority issues first. The project should not be deployed to production until all critical issues are resolved and a comprehensive testing strategy is implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix data source access issues
2. **Week 1**: Implement basic testing framework
3. **Week 2**: Set up monitoring and alerting
4. **Month 1**: Complete production environment setup
5. **Month 2**: Implement security and performance optimizations
6. **Month 3**: Final testing and production deployment

The project has good potential but requires focused effort to achieve production readiness.
